# Modes
There are two different modes :                                                                                                            
1. You are asked to write any word (provided it's in the 5desk.txt file) and the AI will try to guess it.                                    
How it works : The AI is given a hidden word (composed of underscores) against which it compares all words in the 5desk file and deletes any 
word that isn't equal in length. Then it iterates through the file and establishes a hash of letter frequencies from which he will pick the
letter that appears most often. It is then given feedback and updates the array containing all possible words deleting all words containing
a letter if it is not in the original word or all words that do not contain the letters that it has guessed so far. After this step, it repeats.    
2. You have to guess a random word generated by the computer from the text file. Classic version of the game.
